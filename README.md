Good day, and how are you doing. 

I am Matt. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to finish the EOG project and I am really enjoyed doing it. It was a wonderful experience for me to learn more about graphQL and Apollo subscription. 

While I was doing this project, I found that graphQL is a very powerful tool for requesting the data we need in a single query, and the color is very important for data visualization because the quite different colors are very helpful for audiences to recognize the difference between those data.

I am excited about the possibility of joining your company as a UI developer. I look forward to hearing from you about our potential next step. If there is anything information you need, please contact me at any time.
